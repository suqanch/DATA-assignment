Estimated migrant arrivals by citizenship, visa type and CLPR, 12/16-month rule (Annual-Dec) data set

Footnotes:			
The standard error indicates the uncertainty of the provisional migration estimate. For example, the 95 percent confidence interval is +/-1.96 standard errors.			
These intervals reflect the model uncertainty, not the extent of future revisions to provisional data. Standard errors are non-additive.			
Owing to rounding, individual figures may not sum to stated totals.			
Visa type is available from July 2003			
The immigration visa type is that held or granted on arrival in New Zealand. People may change their visa type while still in New Zealand.

Estimated Resident Population Change by component (1991+) (Annual-Dec) data set			
	
Footnotes:	
All population estimates at 30 June 2018 and beyond use the 2018-base ERP.	
Estimates flagged as provisional are subject to revision, mainly to incorporate revisions to external (international) migration estimates.	
Net migration estimates up to June 2013 use the intentions-based permanent and long-term measure of migration.	
Net migration estimates after June 2013 use the new outcomes-based migration measure, based on actual time spent in and out of New Zealand after the border crossing.	
Net migration estimates after June 2013 may differ slightly from other published migration estimates because of differences in the timing of when they are calculated.	
Natural increase plus net migration. The difference between population change and the sum of natural increase and net migration prior to 30 June 2018 is due to intercensal adjustments.
