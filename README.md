--------Scraping data from Trustpilot
In this assignment we attempt to do web scraping on a review website called 'Trustpilot'. Trustpilot is a platform that hosts reviews from consumers, so that other consumers can utilise the information from this site to make choices and judgements.
We plan to extract the company/business name, the number of reviews made for the specific company, the rating, what sub-category this company belongs to, and also give evaluation as to what tier the company would belong using our own methodology.
